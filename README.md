## Tech Stack

[Redux](https://redux.js.org/): Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. I used to hold a single source of truth in the entire app.

[React](http://reactjs.org): React is a library that makes it painless to create interactive UIs.

[React LazyLoad](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-lazyload): Lazyload your Components, Images or anything matters the performance. I replaced the images to load with a placeholder image until the load was finished.
